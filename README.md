It is intended to simulate the operation of a game of luck, in this case the Euro Millions.
In Euro Millions, keys are drawn (composed of five numbers and two stars).
The numbers of a key are between 1 and 50 and cannot be repeated, whereas the stars of a key
are between 1 and 12 and cannot be repeated either.
Although it is possible to build keys by choosing more numbers and/or stars, let's assume that in this application,
each key must have five numbers and two stars.

The application must:
1. Allow the user to play with a manually entered key;
2. Validate the entered key as you see fit;
3. Show the entered game key in an orderly manner;
4. Generate a random key (drawn key) also with five numbers and two stars;
5. Show the key drawn in an orderly manner;
6. Validate the occurrence of the same numbers and stelae, informing how many, which ones and which prize is awarded
(this award is just an example).

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• This application only works for one user, there is no need to login.
• Each move can correspond to a new execution of the program or during execution it can be
the possibility of carrying out a new draw is available.
• For this application, the keys are composed only of five numbers and two stars.

VALUES:
•Suggest and implement additional features that are considered useful and interesting within the scope of
application. Example:
o Allow the user to play with a randomly generated key
o Allow the user to play with composite keys (more numbers and/or more stars)
o Implement a menu system to ask the user what they want to do and repeat the
process.
